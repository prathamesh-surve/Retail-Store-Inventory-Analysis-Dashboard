Retail Sales Forecasting Dashboard – Power BI

Project Objective:

The goal of this project is to analyze sales performance across categories, regions, and time periods, and evaluate how factors such as seasonality, weather, promotions, and epidemics impact revenue, demand, and inventory. The insights derived can help optimize pricing, improve inventory planning, and enhance demand forecasting.


Dataset Overview:

1. Time-series retail dataset from Kaggle, refined to 76,000 rows for accuracy

2. Enriched with an ‘Epidemic’ feature to reflect real-world conditions (e.g., COVID-19)

3. Enables more reliable forecasting considering external factors such as seasonality, weather, and promotions



Tools Used:

1. Python – for data preprocessing and modeling

2. Power BI – for interactive dashboard visualization

3. Microsoft Excel – for initial data exploration and cleaning

4. Microsoft PowerPoint – for presentation and insights reporting


Conclusion:

1. Analysis highlights gaps between demand and supply, emphasizing the need for improved inventory management, especially in low-turnover stores.

2. External factors like epidemics significantly affect operations and must be considered in planning.


Recommendations:

1. Inventory Optimization: Use ABC analysis to classify stock based on impact and sales velocity metrics to assess productivity.

2. Forecasting Improvements: Utilize machine learning models to predict sales and guide ordering trends.

3. Product Strategy: For declining products, consider introducing new, more profitable items.

4. Seasonal Planning: Prepare inventory for high-demand periods (summer/fall) and use discounts or bundles to manage spring inventory.

5. Marketing Strategies: Apply effective strategies from previous years (e.g., extended warranties, holiday packages) to improve ad campaigns and sales in future seasons.
